# hello-world
My first practice repository -- NOTEBOOK MD. Just learned that you can download to edit
and then upload back to a branch. Just for this first tilme, I will be try to upload it back to the 
branch "readme-edits"

I edited some more on the editing branch

Okay, it succesfully merged to the master. For practive, editing on the "readme-edits" branch
, and now I even try to insert to the original lines at the begining of the file
, and see what are the options
