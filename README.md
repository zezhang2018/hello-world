# hello-world
My first practice repository -- NOTEBOOK MD. Just learned that you can download to edit
and then upload back to a branch. Just for this first tilme, I will be try to upload it back to the 
branch "readme-edits"
Right now, on MacPro, default app to open it is Xcode, though I have tried with Page
Last time I mistakenly uploaded to the master branch and committed. This time I will make sure
I update it to the "readme-edits" branch
